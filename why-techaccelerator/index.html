    <h3> One Enviornment for Success </h3>
     <p>
       TechAccelerator provides on-demand, hands-on lab environments that educate,
       engage and ultimately empower enterprise customers, direct sales teams and channel partners,
       so they can get from demo to PoC to PO faster.

        We focus on Technology Vendors whose products are sold to Enterprise customers through
        multiple channels - Direct, Value Added Resellers (VARs) and Systems Integrators (SIs).
        These companies tend to focus on traditional IT Infrastructure - Storage, Networking, Backup and Security.

        Sales processes in these cohorts face one looming challenge, demonstrating the value and purpose of their
        solution.  Overcoming their customer's litmus of questions and viability concers is accomplished through
        onsite demos and often build outs of PoC's in the production envirornments.  Sales Engineering time, shipping hardware,
        various consultants, lead to unknown customer aquisition costs and delayed deal closes.

        At TechAccelerator, our core competency is building scalable, repeatable, sustainable sales processes.
        The TechAccelerator platform has evolved over the years to empower your ecosystem. We enable:
          <ul>
            <li>Manufacturers</li>
            <li>Value Added Resellers (VARs)</li>
            <li>Distributors</li>
            <li>System Integrators</li>
            <li>Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)</li>
            <li>Enterprise IT Departments</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
        Instead of trying to do CRM, PRM, LMS in-house, youâ€™ve already moved to SaaS platforms like Salesforce, Marketo & Litmus.
        Your business focus should be building your product, not building the tools to help sell and market it.</p>
