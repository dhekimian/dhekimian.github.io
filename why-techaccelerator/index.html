    <p>
      Our current market focus is on Technology Vendors whose products are sold to Enterprise customers through multiple channels - Direct, Value Added Resellers (VARs) and Systems Integrators (SIs). These companies tend to focus on traditional IT Infrastructure - Storage, Networking, Backup and Security.
    </p>

    <p>
      These companies tend to have the same common challenges:
      <ul>
        <li>Long Sales Cycles</li>
        <li>Complex Products that are difficult to Demo</li>
        <li>Part of a Solution / not a stand alone product</li>
        <li>Too many opportunities to ship out High End / Expensive Hardware  </li>
        <li>Data exists in multiple systems</li>
      </ul>
    </p>


<div style="background: #f0f0f0">
    <h4>So why don’t we have dozens and dozens of customers?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>We’ve been very selective and careful with our first dozen customers</li>
      <li>We wanted to make sure we could Nail the solution before Scaling</li>
      <li>We wanted customers who were willing to partner closely with while we build out our core feature set</li>
    </ul>


    (Alternative)
    <h4>You’re selective choosing service providers. We’re just as selective adding customers.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>We tailor our platform to your specific business needs.</li>
      <li>We work closely with your sales, marketing, and learning teams to develop and publish integrated content for your portal.</li>
      <li>Our customers continue to influence our build-out of features and integrations.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

    <h4>Executive Conversations</h4>
    <p>
      Almost every C-Level executive we talk to in our target market segment instantly gets our value proposition and if the decision were up to them, they would mandate the usage of TechAccelerator. But in almost every case, we hear something along the lines of:
      <blockquote>
      “I really need my senior management (VP Marketing, Sales, Sales Operations, Channel, Services) take a look since I need to rely upon them to embrace TechAccelerator to have any chance of success and wide adoption.”
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually we get 2 or 3 of the Senior Execs to take a meeting for us to walk through our extensive feature set. These calls usually end up lasting 90+ minutes as they continue to ask questions about our capabilities and want us to show them live examples to verify we’re not blowing smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are some of our best conversations. Why? Because for many of them, this is not their first rodeo. They’ve been building Marketing, Sales, Channels or Services organizations for the past decade or longer. They are keenly aware of the challenges that they faced in the past. Many of them don’t want to repeat past mistakes in their new role as they scale their current organization.
    </p>


    <h4>So why don’t we have dozens and dozens of customers?</h4>
    <ul>
      After demonstrating our impressive feature set, we often hear the following:
      <li>I don’t have budget for something like this, this year… Check with &lt;other sr exec&gt; as he might.</li>
      <li>We just not big enough for something like this, yet.</li>
      <li>Our SE’s are able to do demo’s on their laptop’s</li>
      <li>We already offer a free trial of our software right on our website</li>
      <li>Our product is difficult to demo, so we want one of our Inside Sales Reps to hand hold customers</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Why not building it in-house…</h4>
    <p>
      Most organizations already have projects underway that overlap with our offering… That’s expected. Marketing uses SaaS like Marketo to build customer profiles and tracking. Salesforce adoption has become ubiquitous due to the cross functional feature sets for Marketing, Sales, Channel, Finance, etc. Depending on the maturity of the organization, the Customer Success or Training has started building out a Training portal using Litmus.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Need to invest in integrations and development</li>
      <li>Need to scale to a large sales force & channel partners</li>
    </ul>

          <h3 id="">Why not do this In-House?</h3>
          <h4 class="container-center"> Because its not one of your core competencies.</h3>
          <h4 class="container-center"> Because its not what you do.</h3>
           Instead of trying to do CRM, PRM, LMS in-house, you’ve already moved to SaaS platforms like Salesforce, Marketo & Litmus.
           Your business focus should be building your product, not building the tools to help sell and market it.
          <p><br>
          At TechAccelerator, our core competency is building scalable, repeatable, sustainable sales processes.

          TechAccelerator was founded by David Hekimian, the former CTO of Trace3, a Southern California-based Value-Added Reseller (VAR). Over the course of fifteen years, David worked with a variety of companies -- startups to mature corporations -- to help them develop product vision, go-to-market strategies, and scalable business models to increase revenue.
          <p>
          He became increasingly frustrated with the common sales hurdle culprits:
          <ul>
          <li>Long demo and PoC periods</li>
          <li>Time wasted on bad opportunities</li>
          <li>Effort required to maintain a lab</li>
          <li>Inconsistent messaging across channel and sales teams</li>
          <li>Difficulty scaling sales activities</li>
          <li>Inability to quickly gather feedback and iterate</li>
          <li>High cost of shipping equipment</li>
          <li>Poor return on traditional enablement efforts</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          In 2012, David started TechAccelerator with one goal in mind: to create a platform that speeds up and simplifies the enterprise sales cycle.
          </p>
          The TechAccelerator platform has evolved over the years to empower your ecosystem. We enable:
          <ul>
          <li>Manufacturers</li>
          <li>Value Added Resellers (VARs)</li>
          <li>Distributors</li>
          <li>System Integrators</li>
          <li>Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)</li>
          <li>Enterprise IT Departments</li>
          </ul>
          TechAccelerator provides on-demand, hands-on lab environments that educate, engage and ultimately empower enterprise customers, direct sales teams and channel partners, so they can get from demo to PoC to PO faster.
