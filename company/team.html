                <h4>David Hekimian - Founder and CEO </h4>
                Launched TechAccelerator in 2012 with one goal in mind: to create a platform that speeds up and simplifies the enterprise sales cycle.
                Mr. Hekimian is former CTO of Trace3, a Value-Added Reseller (VAR) of Enterprise network architectures for Fortune 500 companies.  Over the course of fifteen years,
                Mr. Hekimian provided advisory roles with a variety of companies -- startups to mature
                corporations -- to help them develop product vision, go-to-market strategies, and scalable business models to
                increase revenue.

                    The enterprise technology industry has been changing at lightning speed. Customers are seeking new and faster ways to integrate disruptive technologies with their existing infrastructure in order to remain competitive. They are also more demanding than ever.

Yet, these new customer needs and expectations donâ€™t quite align with the traditional enterprise sales cycle -- one that is plagued by a long, costly and complex evaluation and approval process. The enterprise sales cycle typically offers interaction with limited usage and visibility, which in turn, reduces the speed of product adoption and integration at the enterprise level.
